# Changelog

This file records notable, user-visible and operational changes. Entries are
added while work is performed; deployment remains a separate, explicitly
approved action.

## Unreleased — 29-July-2026

- Mini Apps: added shared touch-friendly controls, consistent status semantics,
  skeleton queue loading, Telegram haptic feedback, and session-only restoration
  of harmless Portal/Complaint queue context.
- FCA, FarmUp/System Export, and SPIN forms: replaced browser-local sensitive
  recovery drafts with short-lived, verified, server-owned field drafts. File
  attachments are intentionally excluded and must be selected at submission.
- Operations: added the shared glossary, ADR process, known-gap register, and
  repository operating standards for approvals, migrations, audit evidence,
  and release safety.

Migration: `core.0072_miniapp_drafts` is required before this recovery feature
works. It has **not** been applied to production by this change. To undo after
an approved migration, confirm drafts are disposable and run:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate core 0071_accesscontrolpolicystate_and_more
```
