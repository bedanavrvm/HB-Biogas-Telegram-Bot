# Changelog

This file records notable, user-visible and operational changes. Entries are
added while work is performed; deployment remains a separate, explicitly
approved action.

## Unreleased — 30-July-2026

- Render build reliability: the application build no longer runs `apt-get` in
  Render's read-only native build environment. The existing WeasyPrint PDF
  preflight remains, so a base-image library problem still fails clearly
  before deployment.

- Sheets/Drive integration governance: Admin-managed publication contracts now
  define per-register header/field ownership, while explicit read-only audits
  record schema drift, row-pointer/value divergence, and media-root sharing
  posture without copying raw customer values. TAT duplicate-row cleanup now
  proves the surviving immutable Case ID after deletion and re-publishes the
  canonical case before it reports success; failed verification or re-publish
  is retained as failed local audit evidence.

Migration `core.0082_sheet_register_governance` adds the local contract and
audit evidence schema only. It has **not** been applied to production by this
change. To undo after an approved migration, export required audit evidence,
then run:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate core 0081_jawabuapprovalcondition_jawabuapprovaldelegation_and_more
```

- Portal approval and media integrity: credit, final-review, and payment-review
  decisions are now append-only, reason-coded approval records with 90-day
  validity, condition clearing, material-change invalidation, scoped temporary
  delegation, and a separate per-case payment review. A forward JBL visit now
  needs a LAF, a JBL visit photo, and captured location or a stated
  unavailability reason. New visit media uses a non-PII case storage reference
  and retrievals are auditable. `audit_jawabu_visit_media` reports orphan
  candidates without deleting or relinking Drive files.

Migration `core.0081_jawabuapprovalcondition_jawabuapprovaldelegation_and_more`
adds the approval/delegation/media-audit schema and seeds only
`portal.approval.delegation.authorize` for the current Portal `ADMIN` role. It
has **not** been applied to production by this change. To undo after an
approved migration, first export required approval/delegation/media audit
evidence, then run:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate core 0080_physical_document_signoffs
```

## Unreleased — 29-July-2026

- Documents & finance: generated requisitions and final payment workbooks can
  now retain an authorised, physically signed-and-stamped PDF/JPG/PNG scan
  without overwriting the Excel source. The scan and exact source workbook are
  hash-bound, Drive retries are auditable, and the responsible Portal role is
  maker-checker configurable. E-signatures remain intentionally disabled.

Migration `core.0080_physical_document_signoffs` adds retained payment source
bytes, document sign-off policy, append-only sign-off attempts/events, and the
Admin-only `portal.documents.sign` capability. It has **not** been applied to
production by this change. To undo after an approved migration, export any
sign-off evidence that must be retained, then run:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate core 0079_remove_workflowtatdailymetric_unique_workflow_tat_daily_metric_and_more
```

- Customer History and TAT: Portal and TAT now present a single internal
  chronological history for each case, including operational events, customer
  provenance, documents, decisions, corrections/redactions, accountable
  actors, and related customer units. Official SLA status now uses the shared
  Nairobi business calendar while retaining wall-clock time as context.
  Overdue work gains idempotent in-app escalation tiers and a dry-run daily
  trend snapshot command; no Telegram notifications or automated transitions
  are introduced.

Migrations `core.0078_businesscalendarholiday_and_more` and
`core.0079_remove_workflowtatdailymetric_unique_workflow_tat_daily_metric_and_more`
add the managed holiday calendar, append-only timeline annotations,
escalation accountability, and daily TAT projections with branch/role and
known-staff attribution. They have **not** been applied to production by this
change. To undo after an approved migration, preserve any required audit
evidence, then run:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate core 0077_seed_operational_products
```

- Jawabu data quality: `/sysup` and FarmUp now share governed customer identity
  normalization, retain historical phone observations, flag 7-9 digit ID
  exceptions for review, preserve system-export field provenance, and validate
  system products against one Admin-managed catalog. The Admin dashboard now
  reports active-case data-quality coverage and a dry-run command can audit
  active Jawabu cases or a staged `/sysup` batch without writing data.

Migration: `core.0076_governed_jawabu_data_quality` and
`core.0077_seed_operational_products` are required for governed phone history,
provenance, review evidence, and the product catalog. They have **not** been
applied to production by this change. To undo after an approved migration,
first export any provenance/review evidence that must be retained, then run:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate core 0075_tat_workflow_receipts
```

- Workflow integrity: Jawabu Pipeline and TAT now reject stale Mini App
  updates, record explicit transition metadata, preserve reasoned rework
  routes, and expose safe SLA-escalation dry runs. Payment approval behaviour
  and access-policy assignments are unchanged.

- Mini Apps: added shared touch-friendly controls, consistent status semantics,
  skeleton queue loading, Telegram haptic feedback, and session-only restoration
  of harmless Portal/Complaint queue context.
- FCA, FarmUp/System Export, and SPIN forms: replaced browser-local sensitive
  recovery drafts with short-lived, verified, server-owned field drafts. File
  attachments are intentionally excluded and must be selected at submission.
- Operations: added the shared glossary, ADR process, known-gap register, and
  repository operating standards for approvals, migrations, audit evidence,
  and release safety.

Migration: `core.0072_miniapp_drafts` is required before this recovery feature
works. It has **not** been applied to production by this change. To undo after
an approved migration, confirm drafts are disposable and run:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate core 0071_accesscontrolpolicystate_and_more
```

Migration: `core.0073_workflow_integrity`,
`core.0074_backfill_workflow_integrity`, and
`core.0075_tat_workflow_receipts` are required before workflow revision checks,
transition receipts, and SLA records work. They have **not** been applied to
production by this change. To undo after an approved migration, first export
any new transition/SLA audit evidence that must be retained, then run:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate core 0072_miniapp_drafts
```
